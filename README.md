# nodeJs_2.1
In this task you will have to create a simple web application using Node and Express for working with a car dealer stock. Your application should at least have the following routes implemented:
</br>
GET / - Returns a list of all cars available</br>
POST / - Adds a car to the list</br>
GET /:carID - Returns a car with the specified ID</br>
DELETE /:carID - Deletes a car with the specified ID</br>
The list of the cars should persist when the server is restarted. You must generate an ID on the server when adding a new car to the list. If you wish, you can have additional routes, for example modifying a car or retrieving all cars of a given make, filtering them by production year, etc.
